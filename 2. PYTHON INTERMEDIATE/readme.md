# <font color="brown">SEQUENTIAL DATA TYPE</font>
* A SEQUENTIAL DATA TYPE CAN HOLD MULTIPLE HETEROGENEOUS VALUE & THESE VALUES ARE STORED IN SERIES OF INTERNAL MEMORY LOCATION.
* THESE INTERNAL MEMORY LOCATION ARE IDENTIFIED BY CONCEPT OF __`INDEXING`__.


  ## <font color="teal">TYPES OF SEQUENTIAL DATA TYPE</font>
  * STRING
  * LIST
  * TUPLE
  * SET
  * DICTIONARY
  

## <font color="blue" size=5>1. STRING:</font>
* STRING IS A COLLECTION OF ONE or MORE CHARACTERS PUT IN A __SINGLE QUOTE,DOUBLE QUOTE or TRIPLE QUOTES__.
* MULTIPLE LINE STRING CAN BE DENOTED IN __TRIPLE QUOTES__.
* `Eg: "Hello Good Morning" `
* str() IS USED TO CONVERT ANY FORM TO STRING FORM. 


## <font color="blue" size=5>2. LIST:</font>
* IT IS A SEQUENTIAL DATA TYPE WHICH HOLDS MULTIPLE HETEROGENEOUS VALUE.
* THESE VALUES ARE __ENCLOSED BY SQUARE BRACKET `[]` SEPARATED BY COMMA(,)__.
* `Eg: ["APPLE",1,2.5,3,"BALL"] `
* THESE VALUE INSIDE THE SQUARE BRACKETS ARE REFERRED AS __`ELEMENTS`__.
  

> ### <font color="orange" size=5>FEATURES OF LIST:</font>
> * HOLDS MULTIPLE HETEROGENEOUS VALUES.
> * MUTABLE (CHANGEABLE)
> * DUPLICATE VALUES ARE ALLOWED.
> * ORDER IS PRESERVED (INPUT ORDER IS PRESERVED)
> * INDEXING IS POSSIBLE
> * SLICING IS POSSIBLE
> * NESTED LIST IS POSSIBLE.


## <font color="blue" size=5>3. TUPLE:</font>
* IT IS A SEQUENTIAL DATA TYPE WHICH HOLD MULTIPLE HETEROGENEOUS VALUES __SEPARATED BY COMMA (,) AND ELCLOSED IN PARENTHESIS `()`__.
* `Eg: ("APPLE",1,2.3,4,"CAT") `


> ### <font color="orange" size=5>FEATURES OF TUPLE:</font>
> * HOLDS MULTIPLE HETEROGENEOUS VALUES.
> * IMMUTABLE (NOT CHANGEABLE)
> * DUPLICATE VALUES ARE ALLOWED.
> * INDEXING IS POSSIBLE
> * SLICING IS POSSIBLE
> * NESTED TUPLE IS POSSIBLE.


## <font color="blue" size=5>4. SET:</font>
* IT IS A SEQUENTIAL DATA TYPE WHICH HOLD MULTIPLE HETEROGENEOUS VALUES __SEPARATED BY COMMA (,) AND ELCLOSED IN BRACES `{}`__.
* `Eg: {"APPLE",1,2.3,4,"CAT"} `


> ### <font color="orange" size=5>FEATURES OF TUPLE:</font>
> * HOLDS MULTIPLE HETEROGENEOUS VALUES.
> * MUTABLE (CHANGEABLE)
> * DUPLICATE VALUES ARE NOT ALLOWED.
> * ORDER IS NOT PRESERVED.
> * INDEXING IS NOT POSSIBLE
> * SLICING IS NOT POSSIBLE
> * NESTED SET IS POSSIBLE PARTIALLY.
> * CAN NOT HOLD MUTABLE DATA TYPE.


## <font color="blue" size=5>5. DICTIONARY:</font>
* IT IS A SEQUENTIAL DATA TYPE WHICH HOLD MULTIPLE HETEROGENEOUS VALUES / DATA IN THE FORM OF __`KEY-VALUE PAIR`__. 
* EACH KEY-VALUE PAIR IS __SEPARATED BY COMMA (,) AND ELCLOSED IN BRACES `{}`__.
* EACH KEY-VALUE PAIR IS REFERRED AS `__ITEM__`.
* `Eg: {"NAME":"MANUN",1:34,"AGE":24,"GENDER":"MALE"} `
* `"NAME"` IS ASSOCIATED WITH VALUE `"MANUN"`, SO DICTIONARY CAN BE REFERRED AS __`ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY`__.


> ### <font color="orange" size=5>FEATURES OF DICTIONARY:</font>
> * HOLDS MULTIPLE HETEROGENEOUS VALUES IN THE FORM OF __`KEY-VALUE`__ PAIR.
> * MUTABLE (CHANGEABLE)
> * DUPLICATES <br>
>   * DUPLICATES __KEYS__ ARE NOT ALLOWED.
>   * DUPLICATES __VALUES__ ARE ALLOWED.
> * INDEXING IS NOT ALLOWED.
> * SLICING IS NOT ALLOWED.

# <font color="dark blue">CONCEPT OF COPY:</font>

## <font color="gree" size=5>1. REFERENCE COPY:</font>
* IT IS A PROCESS OF CREATING AN INSTANCE OF THE ORIGINAL DATA IN DIFFERENT VARIABLE.
* BUT IN RETURN BOTH VARIABLES ARE POINTING TO SAME MEMORY LOCATION.
* ASSIGNING A VALUE WITHIN ANOTHER VARIABLE.
  *   ` A=B `
    

## <font color="gree" size=5>2. SHALLOW COPY:</font>
* IT IS A PROCESS OF COPYING VALUES FROM ONE MEMORY LOCATION TO ANOTHER MEMORY LOCATION.
* IT IS IMPLEMENTED BY __`.copy`__.
  *   __SYNTAX-1__:
      *   ` B1=A1.copy() `
  *  __SYNTAX-2__:
       ``` import copy
           P=copy.copy(S) ```


## <font color="gree" size=5>3. DEEP COPY:</font>
* IT IS A PROCESS OF COPYING VALUES FROM ONE MEMORY LOCATION TO ANOTHER MEMORY LOCATION INCLUDING NESTED LIST VALUES..
  *  __SYNTAX__:
      ``` import copy
          Y=copy.deepcopy(X) ```
